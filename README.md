## Purpose of application
The purpose of the application is to create a simple logo maker for my projects without having to pay a graphic designer

## How it works 
Using node.js and the inquirer package I'm able to ask a user questions using the terminal, record said answers and use them to create a simple
SVG logo. You nust run the application on the terminal by typing "node [filename]"

## Demonstration
